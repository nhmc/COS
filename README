This package contains code useful for analysis of far-UV spectra taken
with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) in the Hubble Space
Telescope. It allows fast convolution of synthetic spectra with the
non-gaussian COS line spread function required for line fitting, for
the G130M, G160M and all the near UV gratings.  It also includes
utilities for inspecting the data reduced by the COS pipeline, and for
generating a wavelength-dependent line spread function for use with
VPFIT (http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~rfc/vpfit.html).

To install, you must have Cython (http://www.cython.org/) installed,
and then do

  python setup.py build_ext --inplace
